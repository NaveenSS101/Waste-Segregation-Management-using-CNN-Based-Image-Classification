Title: Automatic Waste Segregation System Using CNN-Based Image Classification for Sustainable Waste Management

Problem Statement:
In todayâ€™s world, improper waste segregation leads to severe environmental pollution and inefficient recycling processes. Manual sorting of waste is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. To promote sustainability and improve recycling efficiency, there is a need for an automated system that can accurately classify waste materials into categories such as plastic, paper, metal, and organic waste.

This project aims to design and implement an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically identify and categorize waste types. The system will utilize a trained model built using Google Teachable Machine to classify images and assist in smart waste management practices, contributing toward a cleaner and more sustainable environment.
