# Waste-Segregation-Management-using-CNN-Based-Image-Classification
This project focuses on building an AI-powered waste classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to promote sustainability through smart waste management. The model is trained using Google Teachable Machine to automatically classify waste images into categories like Plastic, Paper, Metal, and Organic.
